# Flipkart_Electronics_Products_Analysis

This is a complete end-to-end data analytics project where I scraped all electronics products listings from **Flipkart** using Python, cleaned and transformed the data in **Power BI**, and created a fully interactive dashboard to analyze brand performance, hardware specs, pricing, ratings and product categories.

The goal? To turn raw e-commerce data into actionable insights and develop a real-world data analytics portfolio project.
